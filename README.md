# Amazon Clone (HTML & CSS)

This is a practice project where I’m building a clone of the **Amazon.com** homepage using **only HTML and CSS**.  
I’m creating it to improve my frontend skills and strengthen my understanding of layout design, responsiveness, and styling.

## Project Status

**Under Development**  
This project is still in progress. I’m continuously updating and refining the design to make it look closer to the real Amazon website.
